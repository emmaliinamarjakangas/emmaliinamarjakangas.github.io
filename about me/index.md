<h1 class="page-header text-center"> About me </h1>

I am a community ecologist, currently working as a postdoc in [Helsinki Lab of Ornithology](https://www.luomus.fi/fi/helsinki-lab-ornithology) led by Aleksi Lehikoinen. I did my PhD at the [Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics](https://www.ntnu.edu/cbd) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2015-2019. Before that I did my BSc and MSc at [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/en) and majored in ecology and evolution while also studying pedagogics, history and statistics.

**Research interests**
Global change in forms of climate change, habitat destruction and fragmentation, invasive species, pollution and overharvesting has created a biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity is deteriorating at various levels of organization from individuals to ecosystems. In my research, I focus on the biodiversity trends at the largest spatial and temporal scales. I'm broadly interested in community ecology, species' interactions, biogeography, species' traits, global change drivers, species distribution modelling, and related to all these: handling large data sets.

**Projects**

Postdoc (2019-present): Effects of climate change on bird communities at large spatiotemporal scales



PhD (2015-2019): Understanding species interactions in the tropics: dynamics within and between trophic levels

Knowledge on how and why species interact with each other can provide invaluable insight into understanding the many-fold effects that the anthropogenic pressures have on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Multiple factors, including species’ co-occurrences, traits and the abiotic environment, define the pairwise interactions and the structure of interaction networks as a whole. My PhD project focused on interactions of tropical tree species and their seed dispersing mutualists in South America. Overall, co-occurrence and interaction patterns showed significant spatial variation across South America, indicating existence of large-scale biogeographical and anthropogenic processes.

Internship (2015)

MSc (2014-2015): Detectability and conservation of moonworts (*Botrychium*) in Finland

Vascular plants are often used as indicators to assess the endangerment status of a habitat. Moonworts (*Botrychium*) are used to assess the value of traditional rural biotopes in Finland because they are rare, endangered, and dependent on disturbed open habitats. If a species is detected imperfectly it is difficult to assess its endangerment reliably, let alone its value as a habitat indicator. In my MSc project, I assessed the detectability and its drivers as well as estimated the minimum population sizes based on citizen science data. When accounting for detectability, the minimum population sizes were nearly ten-fold larger than the raw population sizess. The population sizes also covaried with sampling effort and legislation changes.
