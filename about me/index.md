<h1 class="page-header text-center"> About me </h1>

I am a community ecologist, currently working as a postdoc in [Helsinki Lab of Ornithology](https://www.luomus.fi/fi/helsinki-lab-ornithology) led by Aleksi Lehikoinen. I did my PhD at the [Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics](https://www.ntnu.edu/cbd) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in 2015-2019. Before that I did my BSc and MSc at [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/en) and majored in ecology and evolutionary biology while also studying pedagogics, history and statistics.

Ecological communities consist of different species that interact directly and indirectly with each other. The overarching theme of my research is understanding what makes species' communities as they are and how they will change under the ever-intensifying anthropogenic pressures. In my research, I focus on the biodiversity trends at large spatial and temporal scales and on a wide range of taxa. I'm broadly interested in theoretical ecology, species' interactions, biogeography, species' traits, global change drivers, species distribution modelling, and related to all these: handling large datasets. For more details of past and ongoing research, see ['projects'](https://emmaliinamarjakangas.github.io/projects/).

Despite (or because of) the fact that most of my work requires sitting in front of a computer, I love spending time in nature, both in remote national parks and in the urban forests. I take my mind off work by playing football, taking care of houseplants, pub quizzing and learning Portuguese.
