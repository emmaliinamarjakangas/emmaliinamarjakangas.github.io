<h1 class="page-header text-center"> About me </h1>

I am a community ecologist, currently working as a postdoc in [Helsinki Lab of Ornithology](https://www.luomus.fi/fi/helsinki-lab-ornithology) led by Aleksi Lehikoinen. I did my PhD at the [Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics](https://www.ntnu.edu/cbd) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2015-2019. Before that I did my BSc and MSc at [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/en) and majored in ecology and evolution while also studying pedagogics, history and statistics.

Global change in forms of climate change, habitat destruction and fragmentation, invasive species, pollution and overharvesting has created a biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity is deteriorating at various levels of organization from individuals to ecosystems. In my research, I focus on the biodiversity trends at the largest spatial and temporal scales. I'm broadly interested in community ecology, species' interactions, biogeography, species' traits, global change drivers, species distribution modelling, and related to all these: handling large data sets. The overarching theme of my research is understanding what makes species' communities as they are.
