<p>The international Day of Women and Girls in Science was declared by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/observances/women-and-girls-in-science-day) in 2015 and is celebrated on February 11th every year. This year I celebrated the day by joining the 500 Women Scientists -organization's event online: "What is it like to be a woman in Science". In the event, ten women scientist (including myself) told about their experiences in science and how these experiences could be used to make science more inclusive for all underrepresented groups.

The first paper from Jos√©phine Couet's PhD project has been published. In the study, we found that mountain bird abundances are shifting uphill in Scandinavia and the species with fast pace of life are moving especially fast.
