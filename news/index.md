<p>I got the opportunity to give a public lecture on biodiversity in [Porkkalan lintuviikko](https://porkkalanlintuviikko.fi/) in Kirkkonummi. This was the first time in years that I gave a lecture in Finnish and the first time in years that I gave a lecture targeted to the general audience. Porkkalan lintuviikko is a yearly event for anyone interested in nature and birds and it includes public lectures and field trips. Although Friday evening was not the best time to attract a lot of people, the audience was interested in learning how the biodiversity ensures a stable and functional ecosystem. The highglight of the evening was to have my mother in the audience learning in more detail about my field of work and my own research. Thanks mom for joining! The lecture will be available on [Porkkalan lintuviikko's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@porkkalanlintuviikko7711) soon!<br>

<p>This spring, the Helsinki Lab of Ornithology has been piloting a course 'Climate change and biodiversity: impacts on birds' at University of Helsinki. We have put our heads together to come up with a curriculum that covers climate change impacts on birds from morphology, population dynamics, communities and conservation perspectives. The ~20 MSc students have been great at discussing papers with us and asking critical questions. This course has given us the opportunity to explore pedagogical alternatives to lectures+big exam -format. As a result, the students are preparing graphical abstracts and figure interpretations on selected articles, which will count towards their grades. We have been very impressed by the quality of work. On the right the students are discussing [Stewart et al. 2022 paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13830) in class; I like it when I don't have to do all the talking!<br>

<p>I currently have a couple of months before I start the next postdoc project so I try to use this time to learn new things that I haven't had time to learn before. As a part of that, I participated in a two-day course on science journalism organized by [Suomen Luonto](https://suomenluonto.fi/), the biggest nature magazine in Finland. Writing popularized science text can be tricky for us scientists being used to writing scientific articles. Being bold enough to generalize things, stepping outside the topic and letting other people be experts, and inventing scientific terms in Finnish were big lessons to learn from the course. This #muutos section in Suomen Luonto will feature plenty of global change -related popularized science articles in the next fall, maybe you'll even see something from me there! <br>

[Oikos Finland 2023](https://nordicsocietyoikos.glueup.com/event/oikos-finland-2023-conference-65152/) was a great success! Before the conference, I co-hosted a workshop on 'Careers outside academia', which made me and the workshop participants a bit more hopeful about the future even if the door to the university jobs close. The speakers from different lines of work highlighted useful skills stemming from doing ecology PhDs, such as coding and project & budget management. After speakers' presentations, in 'career speed dating', workshop participants got to meet with all speakers and ask more specific questions about the speakers' career paths and their current organizations. If you're interested in knowing more about careers outside academia in Finland, contact me and I can share some of the summary material. In general, it was rewarding to be one of the conference organizers, because it gave me a chance to implement all those environmental and equality measures that I have been hoping to see in other conferences. Most importantly, I hope that we set an example for future conferences that serving fully vegan food is possible and doable. Being one of the organizers did mean less time spent listening the talks and preparing my own, but I did get to present my work-in-progress study on tolerances of world's birds to human pressures! <br>

<p>Big news to start the new year: I have joined the board of [Society for Conservation Biology, Europe section](https://conbio.org/groups/sections/europe)! I'm really excited to start working on the next ECCB conference, facilitating science-based policies based on conservation research and supporting early career conservation scientists across Europe with awards and opportunities to join interesting webinars. All that should keep me busy during the three-year term on the board! <br>

<p>We all have those papers that have been looking for their final home for a long time. For me it has been this study on the community diversity effects on birds' thermal "stability" under climate change. Finally I can open my celebratory bottle of beer and announce that it has been accepted to Scientific Reports!! Especially in the winter, the overall level of functional diversity in the bird community can buffer the effects of climate change on the community structure. Most importantly, having multiple trophic levels represented in the bird community is especially beneficial for the buffering against climate change induced changes in the community structure. Yet another reason to address biodiversity and climate crises together and not separately! You can now find a link to the open access article in the ['publications'](https://emmaliinamarjakangas.github.io/publications/) page! Here are also links to the press release of the publication in [English](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/climate-change/biodiversity-safeguards-bird-communities-under-changing-climate) and in [Finnish](https://www.helsinki.fi/fi/uutiset/ilmastonmuutos/monimuotoisuus-suojaa-lintuyhteisoja-ilmastonmuutoksen-vaikutuksilta). <br>

<p>After attending plenty of conferences, I have for the first time gotten a chance to enter the other side and particiate in organizing the next [Oikos Finland 2023 conference](https://nordicsocietyoikos.glueup.com/event/oikos-finland-2023-conference-65152/). There's plenty happenging behind the scenes and the registration will open in December, but most importantly we have secured a great line-up of plenary speakers (Nerea Abrego - University of Jyväskylä, Bengt-Gunnar Jonsson - Mid Sweden University, Aino Juslén - SYKE & Craig Primmer - University of Helsinki) and two pre-conference workshops (Careers outside academia & Reproducible science). Particularly close to my heart have been all those decisions in the conference organization that address the sustainability and the actions that especially us ecologists need to take during the times of biodiversity and climate crises: serving only vegan or vegetarian food, encouraging people to arrive by train, and organizing a [Scientist Rebellion](https://scientistrebellion.com/) session during one of the lunch breaks. I hope to see many fellow ecologist in Helsinki 13.-15.2.2023! <br>

<p>What does an ornithology lab do for a recreation day? Go bird ringing of course! In Laajalahti ringing station, in sunny weather, we captured a bunch of reed buntings, blue tits and even one fierce bearded reedling. It turned out that my superpower is differentiating the shades of blue in blue tit males and females.  <br>

<p> Bunch of applications submitted!! Fingers crossed for funding for the next few years studying ecological network rewiring under global change. Now a long wait to hear the results, but also some time to focus on the current project for a change... <br>

<p>The second conference for this summer was ECCB2022 in Prague, where us [Helsinki Lab of Ornithology](https://www.luomus.fi/fi/helsinki-lab-ornithology)  members contributed with talks, a poster and a symposium, a pretty impressive selection I would say! I presented the latest part of my postdoc project on identification of keystone species in climate change context, stay tuned for the (hopefully-soon) published paper on the topic! <br>

<p>I got the rare opportunity to help out with Joséphine Couet's fieldwork in Kilpisjärvi, Sápmi (Finland). The goal of this small pilot was to study the breeding success of Meadow Pipits and Lapland Buntings across an altitudinal gradient, but the nests of these ground-nesting birds proved hard to find! Although we didn't find enough nests for statistical analyses, we luckily gained plenty of behavioural and ecological knowledge on the coexistence of birds along mountain slopes and in varying microhabitats. And the camping site couldn't have been more beautiful! <br>

<p>The in-person conferences are happening after a long pause by the pandemic. In Nordic Oikos Conference in Aarhus (Denmark), I gave a presentation on a work-in-progress paper about the effects of large-scale barriers on bird community shifts under climate change (find the preprint of the paper [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1347347/v1)). It was great to see so many familiar faces in the conference after two years, the Nordic community of ecologists is truly warm and welcoming! <br>

<p>Better late than never: I finally managed to do the long-planned research stay at Centre for Research into Ecological & Environmental Modelling ([CREEM](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/)) at University of St Andrews. During the three weeks, I kickstarted a project about global bird species' tolerances to human influence using eBird data with Dr Alison Johnston. I also got to visit the Isle of May and its dense sea bird colonies. Talk about species' interactions among the birds that coexist in such high numbers on the tiny island... And I got to see the puffins for the first time! <br>

<p>The international Day of Women and Girls in Science was declared by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/observances/women-and-girls-in-science-day) in 2015 and is celebrated on February 11th every year. This year I celebrated the day by joining the 500 Women Scientists -organization's event online: "What is it like to be a woman in Science". In the event, ten women scientist (including myself) told about their experiences in science and how these experiences could be used to make science more inclusive for all underrepresented groups. Join the [500 Women Scientists -organization](https://500womenscientists.org/) to find out about future events. <br>

<p>The first paper from Joséphine Couet's PhD project has been published. In the study, we found that mountain bird abundances are shifting uphill in Scandinavia and the species with fast pace of life are moving especially fast.
