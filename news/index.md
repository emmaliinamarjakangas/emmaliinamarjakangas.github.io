I gave a presentation on a work-in-progress paper in Nordic Oikos Conference in Aarhus, Denmark. You can find the preprint of the paper [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1347347/v1). It was great to see so many familiar faces in the conference after two years, the Nordic community of ecologists is really warm and welcoming!

A few weeks' research stay at Centre for Ecological Modeling at St Andrews University to kickstart a project about global bird species' tolerances to human influence with Dr Alison Johnston. I got to visit the Isle of May and the DENSE sea bird colonies there. Talk about species' interactions among the birds that coexist in such high numbers on a tiny island like that! And I got to see the puffins for the first time ever!

<p>The international Day of Women and Girls in Science was declared by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/observances/women-and-girls-in-science-day) in 2015 and is celebrated on February 11th every year. This year I celebrated the day by joining the 500 Women Scientists -organization's event online: "What is it like to be a woman in Science". In the event, ten women scientist (including myself) told about their experiences in science and how these experiences could be used to make science more inclusive for all underrepresented groups. Join the [500 Women Scientists -organization](https://500womenscientists.org/) to find out about future events. <br>

The first paper from Jos√©phine Couet's PhD project has been published. In the study, we found that mountain bird abundances are shifting uphill in Scandinavia and the species with fast pace of life are moving especially fast.
