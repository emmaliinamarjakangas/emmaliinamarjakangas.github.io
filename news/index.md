<p>I got the rare opportunity to help out in Joséphine Couet's fieldwork in Kilpisjärvi, Sápmi (Finland). The goal of this small pilot was to study the breeding success of Meadow Pipits and Lapland Buntings across an altitudinal gradient, but the nests of these ground-nesting birds proved hard to find! Although we didn't find enough nests for statistical analyses, we luckily gained plenty of behavioural and ecological knowledge on the coexistence of birds along mountain slopes and in varying microhabitats. And the camping site couldn't have been more beautiful! <br>

<p>The in-person conferences are happening after a long pause by the pandemic. In Nordic Oikos Conference in Aarhus (Denmark), I gave a presentation on a work-in-progress paper about the effects of large-scale barriers on bird community shifts under climate change (find the preprint of the paper [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1347347/v1)). It was great to see so many familiar faces in the conference after two years, the Nordic community of ecologists is truly warm and welcoming! <br>

<p>Better late than never: I finally managed to do the long-planned research stay at Centre for Research into Ecological & Environmental Modelling ([CREEM](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/)) at University of St Andrews. During the three weeks, I kickstarted a project about global bird species' tolerances to human influence using eBird data with Dr Alison Johnston. I also got to visit the Isle of May and its dense sea bird colonies. Talk about species' interactions among the birds that coexist in such high numbers on the tiny island... And I got to see the puffins for the first time! <br>

<p>The international Day of Women and Girls in Science was declared by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/observances/women-and-girls-in-science-day) in 2015 and is celebrated on February 11th every year. This year I celebrated the day by joining the 500 Women Scientists -organization's event online: "What is it like to be a woman in Science". In the event, ten women scientist (including myself) told about their experiences in science and how these experiences could be used to make science more inclusive for all underrepresented groups. Join the [500 Women Scientists -organization](https://500womenscientists.org/) to find out about future events. <br>

<p>The first paper from Joséphine Couet's PhD project has been published. In the study, we found that mountain bird abundances are shifting uphill in Scandinavia and the species with fast pace of life are moving especially fast.
